                The tiger (Panthera tigris) has been a flagship species for biodiversity and wildlife conservation in India since 1972.
                The tiger being an apex predator is on top of the food chain and helps keeps wild ungulate numbers in check, thus also ensuring a balance
                of the herbivores and the vegetation.

                These majestic animals play an integral role as indicators of the health of the ecosystems they thrive in.
                India has taken strong measures to conserve tigers and their habitats in the past few years. As a result, today India supports by far the largest
                number of tigers globally. However, continuous efforts are required to eliminate the threats to the species.
